## 1. Cost Categories

Running AI Cost Monitoring has four primary cost categories:

```
Platform Operating Cost = Infrastructure + LLM Inference + Cloud API + Operations
```

| Category | Description | Scales With |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Infrastructure** | Compute, database, storage, networking | Number of tenants + data volume |
| **LLM Inference** | Gemini / Claude API calls for agent responses | Number of interactive queries |
| **Cloud API Calls** | AWS/Azure/GCP API calls for data sync + live queries | Number of cloud accounts × sync frequency |
| **Operations** | Monitoring, logging, backup, support | Relatively fixed |

## 2. Per-Tenant Cost Model

### 2.1 Infrastructure Cost per Tenant

Shared infrastructure amortized across tenants (GCP serverless example):

| Component | Monthly Cost (100 tenants) | Per Tenant | Notes |
|-----------|---------------------------|------------|-------|
| Cloud Run (all services) | $300-500 | $3.00-5.00 | Pay-per-use, scales to zero |
| Cloud SQL PostgreSQL (db-n1-standard-2) | $100 | $1.00 | Shared, RLS isolated |
| BigQuery (billing export queries) | $10-30 | $0.10-0.30 | Serverless analytics |
| Cloud Tasks + Scheduler | $10 | $0.10 | Serverless background jobs |
| Cloud Storage (reports) | $10 | $0.10 | Per-tenant path |
| Cloud Memorystore Redis (optional) | $40 | $0.40 | 1GB instance for L2 cache |
| Cloud Load Balancing + CDN | $50 | $0.50 | Shared |
| Cloud Monitoring/Logging | $50 | $0.50 | Shared |
| **Subtotal** | **$570-690** | **$5.70-6.90** | |

**Cost advantage:** Serverless saves ~$1,460/month vs Kubernetes ($2,150 - $690 = $1,460).

At scale (500 tenants), per-tenant infrastructure cost drops to ~$2-3/month.

### 2.2 LLM Inference Cost per Tenant

Based on estimated query volume and token usage:

| Metric | Free Tier | Pro Tier | Enterprise Tier |
|--------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| Queries per month | 100 | 1,000 | 5,000+ |
| Avg input tokens per query | 2,000 | 2,000 | 3,000 |
| Avg output tokens per query | 1,000 | 1,000 | 1,500 |
| LLM model | Gemini 2.0 Flash | Gemini 2.0 Flash | Gemini 2.0 Pro / Claude |

**LLM cost per query** (estimated, Gemini 2.0 Flash pricing):

| Component | Tokens | Cost |
|-----------|--------|------|
| Input (system + context + query) | ~2,000 | ~$0.0003 |
| Output (response) | ~1,000 | ~$0.0006 |
| Multi-agent overhead (2-3 agents per query) | ×3 | ×3 |
| **Total per query** | | **~$0.003** |

**Monthly LLM cost per tenant:**

| Tier | Queries | Cost per Query | Monthly LLM Cost |
|------|---------|---------------|------------------|
| Free | 100 | $0.003 | $0.30 |
| Pro | 1,000 | $0.003 | $3.00 |
| Enterprise | 5,000 | $0.004 (Pro model mix) | $20.00 |

### 2.3 Cloud API Cost per Tenant

Cloud provider API calls for data sync (Mode 2):

| API | Calls per Sync | Syncs per Day | Monthly Calls | Cost per 1K | Monthly Cost |
|-----|---------------|---------------|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| AWS Cost Explorer | 10-50 | 6 | 1,800-9,000 | $0.01 | $0.09 |
| AWS CloudWatch | 50-200 | 6 | 9,000-36,000 | Free tier | $0.00 |
| Azure Cost Management | 10-30 | 6 | 1,800-5,400 | Free | $0.00 |
| GCP Cloud Billing | 10-30 | 6 | 1,800-5,400 | Free | $0.00 |
| **Total per account** | | | | | **~$0.10 - $1.00** |

**Note:** AWS Cost Explorer is the most expensive API at ~$0.01 per request. Other providers have free/low-cost billing APIs. A tenant with 5 AWS accounts ≈ $0.50-5.00/month in cloud API costs.

### 2.4 Total Per-Tenant Cost Summary

| Cost Component | Free Tier | Pro Tier | Enterprise Tier |
|---------------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| Infrastructure (shared) | $21.50 | $21.50 | $25.00 |
| LLM inference | $0.30 | $3.00 | $20.00 |
| Cloud API calls | $0.50 | $2.00 | $10.00 |
| Operations overhead | $2.00 | $2.00 | $5.00 |
| **Total cost per tenant** | **$24.30** | **$28.50** | **$60.00** |

At scale (500 tenants), infrastructure share drops significantly:

| Cost Component | Free (at scale) | Pro (at scale) | Enterprise (at scale) |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Infrastructure | $8.00 | $10.00 | $15.00 |
| LLM inference | $0.30 | $3.00 | $20.00 |
| Cloud API calls | $0.50 | $2.00 | $10.00 |
| Operations | $1.00 | $1.00 | $3.00 |
| **Total** | **$9.80** | **$16.00** | **$48.00** |

| Pro | $49 | $16.00 | $33.00 (67%) |
| Enterprise | $199 | $48.00 | $151.00 (76%) |

**Free tier economics:** The free tier is an acquisition channel. Target: 10% conversion to Pro within 3 months. At 10% conversion, the blended acquisition cost is ~$98 per Pro customer ($9.80 × 10 free users).

### 3.3 Breakeven Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Fixed monthly cost (team + infrastructure base) | ~$15,000 (estimated) |
| Breakeven at Pro-only pricing | 455 Pro tenants |
| Breakeven at 70% Pro + 30% Enterprise mix | 165 paid tenants |
| Target Year 1 | 200 paid tenants |

## 6. Value Metrics for Customers

The strongest selling point is demonstrable ROI:

| Metric | How We Track It | Customer Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Total savings identified | Sum of recommendation estimated_savings | "We found $X in savings" |
| Total savings realized | Sum of executed recommendation actual_savings | "You saved $X" |
| Time to insight | Average query response time | "Answers in seconds, not hours" |
| Anomaly detection speed | Time from cost change to alert | "Caught a $5K/day leak in 4 hours" |
| Coverage | % of cloud accounts monitored | "100% visibility across 3 clouds" |

**Target value proposition:** Platform pays for itself within the first month. A single rightsizing recommendation can save more than the annual subscription cost.

## Developer Notes

> **DEV-COST-001:** Implement LLM token counting and cost tracking from day one. Store per-query token usage in the query_interactions table. This is essential for monitoring margin per tenant.

> **DEV-COST-002:** The free tier rate limit (100 queries/month) should be enforced at the AG-UI server level with a simple counter in Redis. Show the user their remaining quota in the UI.

> **DEV-COST-003:** Cloud API costs are the hardest to predict because they depend on tenant account size. Implement metering for cloud API calls per tenant to identify outliers that might need usage-based pricing adjustments.

> **DEV-COST-004:** Cloud Run with min instances = 0 is safe for most services because startup time is < 1 second. Only backend API needs min = 1 for low latency. Background jobs via Cloud Tasks automatically retry on failure.

> **DEV-COST-005:** The savings tracking feature (recommendation estimated vs. actual) is the most important business metric. It directly proves platform ROI to customers. Build this measurement pipeline in Phase 5 alongside the self-learning Loop 2.

> **DEV-COST-006:** Consider usage-based pricing as a future option for Enterprise tier — charge per cloud account monitored rather than a flat fee. This aligns cost with value better for large customers with 50+ accounts.
