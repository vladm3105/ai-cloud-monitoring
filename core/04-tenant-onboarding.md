## 1. Onboarding Overview

Onboarding is the most critical user journey — it's the first experience a customer has with the platform. A new tenant goes from "just signed up" to "seeing their first cost dashboard" in this flow.

### 1.1 Onboarding Stages

```
Sign Up → Create Organization → Connect Cloud Accounts → First Data Sync → Dashboard Ready
   │              │                      │                      │               │
   ▼              ▼                      ▼                      ▼               ▼
 Auth0        PostgreSQL            OpenBao +              Celery Job       Interactive
 User +       tenant +              Cloud Account          → MCP Servers    Mode Ready
 Org          admin user            verification           → TimescaleDB
```

### 1.2 Time Targets

| Stage | Target Duration | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| Sign up + org creation | < 2 minutes | Auth0 Universal Login + form |
| Connect first cloud account | < 5 minutes | Guided wizard, copy-paste credentials |
| First data sync | 5-15 minutes | Depends on account size |
| **Total: Sign up to dashboard** | **< 20 minutes** | For a single-cloud, small account |

---

## 2. Stage 1: Sign Up & Organization Creation

### 2.1 Flow

```
User clicks "Get Started"
  → Auth0 Universal Login (sign up with email or SSO)
    → Auth0 creates User
      → Platform creates Auth0 Organization
        → Platform creates tenant record in PostgreSQL
          → Platform assigns user as org_admin of new tenant
            → Redirect to onboarding wizard
```

### 2.2 What Gets Created

| System | Entity | Details |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Auth0 | User | Email, password (or SSO link) |
| Auth0 | Organization | `org_{slug}`, display name |
| Auth0 | Membership | User → Organization with `org_admin` role |
| PostgreSQL | tenant | id, name, slug, auth0_org_id, plan=free, status=onboarding |
| PostgreSQL | user | Synced from Auth0, role=org_admin |
| OpenBao | Tenant path | `secret/tenants/{tenant_id}/` (empty, ready for credentials) |
| Redis | Session | User session initialized |

### 2.3 Business Rules

- Default plan is `free` — can be upgraded later
- The first user is always `org_admin`
- Tenant `status` is `onboarding` until first cloud account is connected and synced
- Organization slug is derived from company name (URL-safe, unique)

## 3. Stage 2: Connect Cloud Accounts

### 3.1 Cloud Account Connection Wizard

The wizard guides the user through connecting their first cloud account. Each provider has a different credential mechanism:

#### AWS Connection

```
Step 1: User selects "Connect AWS Account"
Step 2: Platform displays a CloudFormation template URL
        (creates IAM Role with specific permissions + External ID)
Step 3: User deploys the template in their AWS console
Step 4: User copies the Role ARN back into the wizard
Step 5: Platform stores Role ARN + External ID in OpenBao
Step 6: Platform tests: AssumeRole → GetCallerIdentity
Step 7: Success → cloud_account created with status=active
```

**What the IAM Role allows (read-only + limited write for remediation):**
- Cost Explorer: GetCostAndUsage, GetCostForecast, GetAnomalies
- Compute Optimizer: Get* (read-only)
- CloudWatch: GetMetricData, GetMetricStatistics
- EC2: Describe* (read), StopInstances, ModifyInstanceAttribute (remediation)
- Trusted Advisor: Describe* (read-only)
- Resource Groups: GetResources, SearchResources

#### Azure Connection

```
Step 1: User selects "Connect Azure Subscription"
Step 2: Platform displays instructions to create a Service Principal
        (App Registration with Reader + Cost Management Reader roles)
Step 3: User provides: Client ID, Client Secret, Azure Tenant ID, Subscription ID
Step 4: Platform stores credentials in OpenBao
Step 5: Platform tests: authenticate → list subscriptions
Step 6: Success → cloud_account created
```

#### GCP Connection

```
Step 1: User selects "Connect GCP Project"
Step 2: Platform displays instructions to create a Service Account
        (with Viewer + Billing Account Viewer roles)
Step 3: User uploads Service Account JSON key file
Step 4: Platform stores JSON key in OpenBao
Step 5: Platform tests: authenticate → list projects
Step 6: Success → cloud_account created
```

#### Kubernetes Connection

```
Step 1: User selects "Connect Kubernetes Cluster"
Step 2: User provides: Cluster API endpoint + kubeconfig or service account token
Step 3: Platform verifies OpenCost is installed (required)
Step 4: Platform stores credentials in OpenBao
Step 5: Platform tests: list namespaces → check OpenCost endpoint
Step 6: Success → cloud_account created
```

### 3.2 Credential Storage

All credentials go directly to OpenBao — never to PostgreSQL.

| Provider | OpenBao Path | Stored Data |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| AWS | `secret/tenants/{id}/aws/{account_id}` | role_arn, external_id |
| Azure | `secret/tenants/{id}/azure/{subscription_id}` | client_id, client_secret, azure_tenant_id |
| GCP | `secret/tenants/{id}/gcp/{project_id}` | service_account_json |
| K8s | `secret/tenants/{id}/k8s/{cluster_name}` | kubeconfig or token |

### 3.3 Validation & Error Handling

| Validation | Check | On Failure |
|------------|-------|------------|
| Credential format | Regex/schema validation | Inline form error |
| Connectivity test | Attempt API call with provided credentials | "Unable to connect — check permissions" |
| Permission test | Call specific APIs needed by the platform | "Missing permission: ce:GetCostAndUsage" with fix instructions |
| Duplicate check | Same account_identifier already connected | "This account is already connected to your organization" |

---

## 4. Stage 3: First Data Sync

### 4.1 Triggered Immediately After Account Connection

```
Cloud account created (status=active)
  → Celery task triggered: initial_sync_{provider}
    → Phase 1: Resource Inventory (discover all resources)
    → Phase 2: Cost Data (pull last 30 days of cost data)
    → Phase 3: Anomaly Detection (baseline establishment)
    → Phase 4: Recommendations (initial optimization scan)
      → On completion: tenant status → active
        → Notification to user: "Your dashboard is ready!"
```

### 4.2 Sync Progress Tracking

The onboarding UI shows real-time progress:

| Phase | Description | Estimated Time |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| Connecting | Verifying credentials | < 30 sec |
| Discovering resources | Scanning cloud inventory | 1-3 min |
| Loading cost data | Pulling 30-day history | 3-10 min |
| Analyzing patterns | Anomaly baseline + recommendations | 1-3 min |
| Ready | Dashboard populated | — |

Progress is pushed via SSE to the frontend. Each phase updates a `sync_progress` key in Redis.

### 4.3 First Sync Data Scope

| Data | Lookback Period | Purpose |
|------|----------------|---------|
| Cost metrics | 30 days | Enough for trend analysis |
| Resource inventory | Current state | Snapshot of all resources |
| Anomaly baseline | 30 days | Establish normal patterns |
| Recommendations | Current | Initial optimization opportunities |

**After onboarding:** Regular Mode 2 scheduled jobs take over with full lookback periods.

## 5. Stage 4: Dashboard Ready

### 5.1 First-Run Experience

When the user lands on the dashboard for the first time:

```
1. Welcome message: "Your {provider} account is connected. Here's what we found."

2. Key metrics displayed:
   → Total monthly spend (current month)
   → Month-over-month trend
   → Number of resources discovered
   → Initial savings opportunities (if any)

3. Guided suggestions:
   → "Ask me anything about your cloud costs"
   → Example queries shown as clickable chips:
     - "What are my top 5 most expensive services?"
     - "Show me idle resources"
     - "How does this month compare to last month?"

4. Next steps card:
   → "Connect more cloud accounts" (if only one connected)
   → "Invite your team" (user management)
   → "Set up budget alerts" (policy configuration)
```

### 5.2 Tenant Status Transition

| Status | Meaning | Transitions To |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| onboarding | Tenant created, no cloud accounts connected yet | active (after first sync) |
| active | At least one cloud account connected and synced | suspended (admin action or billing) |
| suspended | Access restricted, data retained | active (reactivation) |

---

## 6. Post-Onboarding: Adding More Accounts

After initial onboarding, users can add additional cloud accounts through:

```
Settings → Cloud Accounts → "Add Account"
  → Same wizard as onboarding, but:
     - No Auth0/tenant creation (already exists)
     - Sync runs in background (user can continue using dashboard)
     - Existing data not affected
     - New account data merges into unified view
```

---

## 7. Invite Team Members

```
Settings → Team → "Invite Member"
  → Enter email + select role (analyst, operator, org_admin)
    → Auth0 invitation sent (email with signup link)
      → Invitee creates account → automatically added to Auth0 Organization
        → User record created in PostgreSQL with assigned role
          → Invitee has immediate access per their role
```

**Role assignment during invite:**

| Inviter Role | Can Invite As |
|-------------|---------------|
| org_admin | org_admin, operator, analyst, viewer |
| operator | analyst, viewer |
| analyst | viewer |
| viewer | (cannot invite) |

---

## Developer Notes

> **DEV-ONB-001:** The CloudFormation template for AWS should be hosted on our S3 bucket and versioned. Users click a "Launch Stack" button that opens AWS CloudFormation with the template pre-loaded. The External ID must be unique per tenant to prevent confused deputy attacks.

> **DEV-ONB-002:** Credential validation must happen server-side only. Never send cloud credentials to the frontend or store them in browser storage. The wizard submits credentials directly to the backend, which stores them in OpenBao and returns only a success/failure status.

> **DEV-ONB-003:** First sync should be a dedicated Celery task (not the regular scheduled sync) with different timeout and retry settings. It should prioritize speed over completeness — pull the most important data first, backfill details in subsequent scheduled syncs.

> **DEV-ONB-004:** Track onboarding funnel metrics: sign-up → org created → account connected → first sync complete → first query. Identify where users drop off.

> **DEV-ONB-005:** The "disconnect account" flow must: revoke OpenBao credentials, mark resources as terminated, stop scheduled syncs for that account, and archive (not delete) historical cost data. Data deletion requires a separate "delete data" action per compliance requirements.

> **DEV-ONB-006:** Consider a "demo mode" or "sandbox tenant" with pre-loaded sample data for users who want to explore the platform before connecting real cloud accounts. This reduces friction in the evaluation phase.
